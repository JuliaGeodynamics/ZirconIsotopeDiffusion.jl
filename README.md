# ZirconIsotopeDiffusion.jl
Calculates and provides the Zircon Isotope Diffusion based on the published MATLAB code by [I.N. Bindeman, O.E. Melnik](https://doi.org/10.7185/geochemlet.2241)

This is currently a first translation of the MATLAB code. For now, it cannot be coupled to any other code, which is a WIP.

Run the main_Matlab2Julia.jl file in the REPL due to the global variables, not yet possible as a function call.
