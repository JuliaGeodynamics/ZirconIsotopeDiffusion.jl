# ZirconIsotopeDiffusion.jl
Calculates and provides the Zircon Isotope Diffusion based on the published MATLAB code by [I.N. Bindeman, O.E. Melnik](https://doi.org/10.7185/geochemlet.2241)

This is currently a first translation of the MATLAB code. For now, it cannot be coupled to any other code, which is a WIP.
